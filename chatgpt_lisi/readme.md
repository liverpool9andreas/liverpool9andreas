Flask Web Application
This is a simple Flask web application that calculates the mean of two values entered by the user.

Prerequisites
Before running this application, make sure you have the following installed:

Python (version 3.6 or higher)
Flask (you can install it using pip install flask)
Installation
Clone this repository or download the code files.
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
Run python3 -m venv env to create a virtual environment named "env".
Activate the virtual environment:
On Windows: Run env\Scripts\activate.
On macOS/Linux: Run source env/bin/activate.
Install the required dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
Usage
To start the application, follow these steps:

Make sure you are in the project directory using the terminal or command prompt.
Activate the virtual environment if you created one (see the Installation section).
Run python app.py or python3 app.py to start the Flask development server.
Open a web browser and go to http://localhost:5000 to access the application.
How it Works
The main entry point of the application is the index() function, which handles the root URL /.
When the user visits the root URL, they are presented with an HTML form where they can enter two values.
When the user submits the form, the index() function is called again, but this time with a POST request.
In the POST request, the values entered by the user are retrieved from the form data.
The result() function is then called, passing the chosen option as a parameter in the URL.
In the result() function, if it receives a POST request, it calculates the mean of the two values and renders the result.html template, passing the mean value to it.
If the result() function receives a GET request, it renders the result.html template with None as the mean value.
The result.html template displays the mean value if it is not None.
